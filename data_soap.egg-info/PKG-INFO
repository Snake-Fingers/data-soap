        ## Main Features
        
        - Strips unnecessary characters from numerical data fields in pandas dataframes to ensure consistent data formatting
        - Provides before and after representations of dataframes to allow for comparison

        ## Background
        
        Data-Soap originated from a Code Fellows 401 Python midterm project. The project team includes Alex Angelico, Grace Choi, Robert Carter, Mason Fryberger, and Jae Choi. After working with a few painful datasets using, we wanted to create a library that allows users to more efficiently manipulate clean datasets extracted from CSVs that may have inconsistent formatting.
